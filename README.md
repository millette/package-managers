# Package Managers [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/millette/package-managers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/millette/package-managers) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/millette/package-managers/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/millette/package-managers?branch=master)

Metadata extracted from [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io) about many different package managers in a standard format.

String interpolation of commands and urls is done using [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) in an attempt at cross language compatibility.

All data is stored in JSON where the key for each package manager is the name of the repository in lower case.

Each attribute relates to the source of some information about a package that can be inferred from just the package manager, name of the package and optionally it's version.

See [`package-managers.json`](package-managers.json) for the full data set.

## Data format

```JSON
"rubygems": {
  "install": "gem install {{name}} {{#version}}-v {{version}}{{/version}}",
  "download": "https://rubygems.org/downloads/{{name}}-{{version}}.gem",
  "url": "https://rubygems.org/gems/{{name}}{{#version}}/versions/{{version}}{{/version}}",
  "documentation": "http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/{{name}}/{{version}}"
}
```
